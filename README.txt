EasyCDN Module
====================

This module detects libraries currently installed in sites/all/libraries 
and allows administrators to load these libraries locally or via CDN. The 
current CDN options are: JSDelivr and CDNJS. Libraries are loaded with from
the CDN based on the local version of the library that is installed.

NOTE: If a library or library version cannot be found on the CDN it will default
to loading the library locally.
